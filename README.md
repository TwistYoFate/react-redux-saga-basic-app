# react-redux-saga-basic-app
Created with CodeSandbox

This is a basic app which uses
  - REACT
  - REDUX
  - REDUX-SAGA
  - AXIOS

1 :- This app has a COUNTER implemented using REDUX, which displays a counter value on screen with a button to increase its value.

2 :- It also uses REDUX-SAGA and AXIOS to fetch data from a dummy api and display it on the browser.
      The link to the api fetched is https://my-json-server.typicode.com/TwistYoFate/fakedb/users .
      
Things I learned about making this app are :
  -REACT
  -REDUX
  -REDUX-SAGA
  -AXIOS
